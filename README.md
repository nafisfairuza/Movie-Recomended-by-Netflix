# Movie and TV Show Recommender RAG Chatbot
This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using Streamlit and LangChain, designed to provide movie and TV show recommendations based on a custom dataset derived from a single Kaggle source (merged_data.csv).

The RAG architecture ensures that recommendations are factual and **grounded in the provided data**, enhanced by the reasoning capabilities of the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** Large Language Model (LLM)

# 1. Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle. You can access it here: ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirajshah07/netflix-dataset
  
# 2. Project Architecture & Components
- Framework: Streamlit for the interactive web application interface.

- Data Source: merged_data.csv (Contains information about movies/TV shows).

- LLM (Online Deployment): **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Used for free via `langchain-google-genai`).

- Vector Store: ChromaDB (chroma_db/ folder) for storing vectorized movie data.

- Embeddings: HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (local embeddings used for indexing).

# 3. How to Run Locally
- Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+ installed.

2. **Gemini API Key** (for the online version).

3. Git installed (optional, for cloning).

- Setup
1. Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/nafisfairuza/Movie-Recommender-by-Netflix.git](https://github.com/nafisfairuza/Movie-Recommender-by-Netflix.git)
cd Movie-Recommender-by-Netflix

2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure API Key:
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your key:

    GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAxlJ..."

Note: The .env file is excluded from GitHub via the .gitignore.

5. Build the Vector Store (Initial Setup)
This step processes merged_data.csv and creates the chroma_db/ folder.

python create_vectorstore.py

6. Run the Streamlit App:

streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your web browser.

# 4. Deployment on Streamlit Cloud
This application is ready to be deployed on Streamlit Cloud, provided that the chroma_db/ folder is committed to this repository.

Configuration Steps
Go to Streamlit Cloud and select this repository.

In the deployment settings, you must provide your **Gemini API Key** as a secret.

Add the key/value pair in the Streamlit Cloud secrets configuration:

KEY MUST BE NAMED EXACTLY LIKE THIS
    GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyAxlJ..." 

The app will then load the committed `chroma_db` folder, install the dependencies, and run using the online **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model.
